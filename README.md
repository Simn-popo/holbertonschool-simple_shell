# Holberton School C - Simple Shell project


## Description

The Holberton School's Simple Shell project concludes the first term of the fundamentals program. This group project aims to test our knowledge of the bash shell and C language.

## Requirements
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Have to handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)
* Handle command lines with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* fork must not be called if the command doesn‚Äôt exist
* Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
* Usage: exit
* Don‚Äôt have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
* Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
